Players wear an HTC Vive headset,and hold Vive Controllers in their hands. This allows VR Fitness to provide the player with different colored hand models which move with their body parts. During each exercise sequence, players punch the targets coming at them by matching the color of their hand with the color of the target. Additionally, various obstacles come towards the player that they must duck, dodge, and step over. The patterns of the targets and obstacles were created to get the player to perform common aerobic exercise (standing reach, punch, etc.) moves to the music. A seated exercise routine was also included to show how the game can be used by those who can't exercise standing up (using seated overhead reach, for example) and for physical therapy.
